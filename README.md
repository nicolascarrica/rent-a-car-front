## Technologies Used

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - A fast build tool that provides a development environment and build optimizations.

3. Install dependencies:

4. Configure environment variables. Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add the following variables:
    ```env
